Lessons provide the content for the Fidgetech curriculum and are designated with a book icon and code number, like `1.0.0.7` in this lesson.  Lessons include text to be read and a cheat sheet that summarizes terminology, code and tips from the text. As Fidgetech coursework gets more advanced, students are encouraged to be more independent in using external resources to find solutions for the coding they are undertaking.

Exercises provide coding activities for students to practice the tools and concepts learned in the lessons.  Exercises are designated with a pencil icon and each will also have a code number.  Exercises are composed of several sections: 

### [Goals](#goals)

At the top of each exercise the goals for completing the exercise are outlined. This includes what skills and concepts the specific exercise is focused around, and what we hope you'll gain from completing it.

### [Warm Up](#warm-up)

The warm up section contains discussion questions to think about, and you can ask another student or instructor if you are unsure. These ensure you both have a basic understanding of the concepts the exercise will explore before you begin coding, and provide you an opportunity to review as necessary before jumping into the code. Sometimes warm ups will contain brief reading material to go over, or short exercises, too.

### [Code](#code)

This is the outline of the project or activity you'll be coding. This section generally includes the requirements of the project, and any relevant instructions, tips, tricks, or ideas. 

### [Further Exploration](#further-exploration)

This section contains ideas to take your projects one step further if you finish the basic requirements and wish to keep going. This usually includes adding additional features, exploring bonus concepts, or other fun challenges.  If you finish a project and feel confident in your work we encourage you to push yourself harder with the Further Exploration.

## [Feedback](#feedback)

---
If there is a lesson that really helped grow your understanding or if there is a suggestion you may have for improvement, we value your insight and hope that you will share it with us. We encourage feedback on any issue that comes up — both large and small — whether that is a typo, a passage that is confusing, or an area you feel could use clarification or any other kind of improvement. 

The best way to share feedback is in the curriculum channel in the Fidgetech Discord Server.
