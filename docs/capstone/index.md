Welcome to the Capstone course.

This course will cover several concepts, though it will be different in many ways from what you've encountered in previous courses. This course will have a few sections: 

- Computer Science Concepts
- Professional Development and Self Study
- Team Week/Hackathon
- Capstone Independent Project

Throughout the course, there will be several Career Service events and expectations that focus on job searching, as well as generally making yourself employable. But, for the technical aspect of the curriculum, you will be defining your path forward and researching concepts that you'd like to harness in your Capstone and beyond. 

To navigate through the lessons, you can utilize the side bar to find the section, day, and lesson you'd like to peruse. Otherwise, to navigate sequentially, click the `Next` or `Previous` buttons at the bottom of each page.
