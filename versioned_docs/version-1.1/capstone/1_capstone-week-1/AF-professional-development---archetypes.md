# Professional Development Plan - Archetypes


## Introduction


In this lesson, we hope to provide you with certain "Archetypes" that we believe are examples of noteworthy combinations of the skills listed in the previous lesson.


These Archetypes are not binding, nor are they all-encompassing of skills that might otherwise be left out.


However, once you get to crafting your Professional Development Plan itself, you are welcome to refer back to these Archetypes as inspiration for crafting your plan.


## Archetypes


There are a few Archetypes that are immediately recognizable within the world of Web Development, and several of the skills in the previous lesson can easily fall within any given category. But, before we assign skills to Archetypes, let's define each Archetype.


### Front-End Developer


A front-end developer is responsible for implementing visual elements that users see and interact with in a web application or website. They work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces that facilitate smooth navigation and optimal user experience.


Here are some skills that a Front-End Developer might want to harness, and how you might see them appear in development:


#### Accessible Design
You might ensure that [ARIA principles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) are utilized in a page, or that your site passes the [WCAG standard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).
#### Wireframing
You may need to present a Wireframe of a design to display user stories before beginning development. You may also be given a Wireframe from a design team to work off of when crafting the visuals of a page.

- [Wireframing](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/wireframing.html#:~:text=A%20wireframe%20is%20a%20two,styling%2C%20color%2C%20or%20graphics.)
- [YouTube: What are Wireframes?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2N7Vl6IOVc)

#### Screen readers/aria labels
Like in Accessible Design, you might ensure that ARIA principles are utilized in a page.

- [ARIA principles: MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)
- [Setting Up and Using Screen Readers](https://www.codecademy.com/article/how-to-setup-screen-reader)


#### Responsive design/media queries
Responsive design involves making your application work and perform well on various devices, as well as screen sizes. Most likely by using media queries.

- [MDN: media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries)
- [YouTube: Learn CSS MEdia Query in 7 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU7jJ3NbPdA)

#### Mobile-focused design
Also known as "Mobile-First" design, which means you start your design process with the smallest screen first, then work upwards.

- [A Hands-On Guide to Mobile-First Responsive Design](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/a-hands-on-guide-to-mobile-first-design/)
- [What it is and How to Implement it](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-to-implement-mobile-first-design)

#### UI/UX
Following best practice for UI and UX is a large component of front-end development. 

- [UI/UX Best Practices]([smashingmagazine.com](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/))
- [CodeCademy - Intro to UI and UX Design](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/intro-to-ui-ux)

#### Canvas rendering vs elements
Canvas is the best practice approach to rendering complicated or numerous elements that are specifically designed for display. Instead of using hundreds of `<div>` elements to create visual elements.

- [W3Schools: Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp)
- [MDN: Canvas Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial)

#### Modern staples (Next.js, typescript)
Some tools are now becoming the "hot new item" in the development world. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React framework that improves upon the vanilla React product, and Typescript is a strongly typed language that otherwise is very similar to JavaScript.

#### Additional JS or C# frameworks
Always explore other frameworks that might benefit you. What packages could be beneficial for a project? What frameworks - like Next.js - might solve a problem or create a better experience for you?

#### Open source projects and/or hackathons

All developer Archetypes will benefit from participating in public events, meetups, hackathons, and contributing to open source projects. As a reminder, the [Epicodus Curriculum](https://github.com/orgs/epicodus-curriculum/repositories) is an open source project!

#### Cross-platform software
Software that can work on multiple platforms, such as Web, Mobile, smart watches, or other smart devices is something a front-end developer might consider while designing an application.


### Back-End Developer


A back-end developer focuses on the server-side of web development, dealing with the logic, databases, server, and application. They are responsible for creating the underlying functionality and infrastructure of a web application or website. Back-end developers work with server-side languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, or Node.js, and databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.


Here are some skills that a Back-End Developer might want to harness, and how you might see them appear in development:


#### Data analysis
[Data analysis](https://monkeylearn.com/data-analysis/) involves inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to derive useful insights and make informed decisions. It's a crucial aspect of many fields, including business, science, healthcare, and more.

### Full-Stack/General Developer


A full-stack developer is proficient in both front-end and back-end development, allowing them to work on all aspects of web application development. They have the skills to handle server-side programming, client-side coding, and database management. Full-stack developers are versatile and can work on all layers of the development stack, from user interface design to server-side logic and database management.


Full-Stack development can also be seen as controversial, as companies have moved over to relying on one role for the responsibilities of two. However, being a "Jack of all trades" isn't a bad thing, especially if you are interested in both avenues of development.


In addition to the skills that are listed above for both Front-End and Back-End developers, here are some skills that a Full-Stack Developer might want to harness, and how you might see them appear in development:

#### Content Management Systems
Content Management Systems (CMS) are software platforms that allow users to create, manage, and publish digital content, such as websites and blogs, without requiring advanced technical skills. Examples include WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla.
