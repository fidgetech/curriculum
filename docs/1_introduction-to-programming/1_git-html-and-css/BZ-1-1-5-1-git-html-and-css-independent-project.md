## Independent Projects Overview
---

Welcome to your first independent project!

Project prompts will be available on Fidgetech Code Central once you let your instructor know that you have reached the end of a section. Before you begin your project, make sure to take a moment to review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](../../pre-work/getting-started-at-epicodus/1-0-0-09-independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson. This lesson details:

* How to submit your code
* How feedback works
* Course completion requirements

## Accessing the Project Prompt
---

To access your independent project prompt, follow these steps:

* Login to [Fidgetech Code Central](https://central.fidgetechcode.org/).
* Select your current course.
* On your course page, select this section's code review.
* This will bring you to a code review detail page with:
  * The prompt theme and requirements
  * A list of objectives
  * A list of optional further exploration objectives
  * A location to submit your project
  * A location to leave a submission note for your teacher to read 
* Once you've completed your project, submit the GitHub repository containing your project in the  _Submission_ section of the code review detail page. See below for detailed instructions and a review of deadlines.

## Git, HTML, and CSS Project Objectives
---

Your instructor will review your code for the following objectives:

* The following HTML tags are _all_ used: `p`, `h`, `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `em`, `strong`, `a`, `img`, `div`, and `span`.
* Project includes a custom-made stylesheet that uses typography styles, the box model (including margin, border, and padding), and floats.
* Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indentation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
* Commits are made regularly with clear messages that _finish_ the phrase "It will…"
* The project repo contains a README that includes:
  * application name
  * names of contributors
  * description of application
  * link to site on GitHub Pages
  * a "technologies used" section
  * application setup instructions
  * link to site on GitHub Pages
  * a "known bugs" section
  * copyright, date, and license information
* Site is successfully deployed to GitHub pages.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The prompt’s required functionality and baseline project requirements are met.

### What is a polished, portfolio-quality state?
When a project is both polished and in a portfolio-quality state, this means:

* You've reviewed your project and your README prior to submitting it to make sure there are no errors or missing information and you are consistent in your indentation, spacing, and code structure. 
* You are following the best practices and coding conventions we teach. Make sure that your:
  * Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indentation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
  * Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. `myVariableExample`).
  * Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It will…".

### What are the baseline project requirements?
All independent coding projects at Epicodus have these baseline requirements:

* A complete and informative README
* The project's commit history shows at least 8 hours of work.
* Completion of the project based on the prompt _and_ objectives. The prompt contains details on the project's theme and features that are not always detailed in the objective. Carefully read through the prompt towards the end of your work session to make sure that you are not missing anything.

## Submission
---

Once you've completed your project, submit your code for review to the **Git, HTML and CSS** code review on [Fidgetech Code Central](https://central.fidgetechcode.org/):

* Navigate to the code review detail page on Fidgetech Code Central: 
  * Select _Introduction to Programming_ from the list of courses,
  * Select the code review title corresponding to the section,
* Once on the code review detail page, scroll down to the _Submission_ section and follow these steps:
  * Input the GitHub repository URL containing your project into the _GitHub repo URL_ input.
    * Do **_not_** submit the link to your live GitHub Pages site, i.e.:  `your-username.github.io/your-portfolio`. Instead, submit the link to the GitHub repository containing your code, i.e.: `github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git`.
  * Add a submission note for your teacher to review
  <!-- * Confirm that you "have read and understand the guidelines for Independent Projects" by checking the checkbox.  -->
  * Hit the _Submit Project_ button — you will be taken to a confirmation page.
  <!-- * On the submission confirmation page, select whether or not you want to request a meeting with your teacher -->
