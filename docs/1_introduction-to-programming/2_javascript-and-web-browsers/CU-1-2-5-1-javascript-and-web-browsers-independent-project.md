## Independent Projects Overview
---

Project prompts will be available on Fidgetech Code Central once you let your instructor know that you have reached the end of a section. Before you begin your project, make sure to take a moment to review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](../../pre-work/getting-started-at-epicodus/1-0-0-09-independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson. This lesson details:

* How to submit your code
* How feedback works
* Course completion requirements

## Accessing the Project Prompt
---

To access your independent project prompt, follow these steps:

* Login to [Fidgetech Code Central](https://central.fidgetechcode.org/).
* Select your current course.
* On your course page, select this section's code review.
* This will bring you to a code review detail page with:
  * The prompt theme and requirements
  * A list of objectives
  * A list of optional further exploration objectives
  * A location to submit your project
  * A location to leave a submission note for your teacher to read 
* Once you've completed your project, submit the GitHub repository containing your project in the  _Submission_ section of the code review detail page. See below for detailed instructions and a review of deadlines.

## JavaScript & Web Browsers Project Objectives
---

This section's independent project will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Form gathers input from the user.
* Branching is used to determine the result.
* Web API object properties or methods (not including `window` methods for alerting, prompting, or confirming) are used to display the result to the user.
* Event handler properties or event listeners are used to handle events. 
* When the user submits the form again (for a second or third time) previous results are hidden, cleared, or replaced.
* Variable names are descriptive of what they represent and use lower camel case (e.g. `myVariableExample`).
* Web page is styled using custom CSS.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The prompt’s required functionality and baseline project requirements are met.

### What is a polished, portfolio-quality state?
When a project is both polished and in a portfolio-quality state, this means:

* You've reviewed your project and your README prior to submitting it to make sure there are no errors or missing information and you are consistent in your indentation, spacing, and code structure. 
* You are following the best practices and coding conventions we teach. Make sure that your:
  * Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indentation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
  * Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It will…".

### What are the baseline project requirements?
All independent coding projects at Epicodus have these baseline requirements:

* A complete and informative README
  * It is _not_ required to include a link to your site hosted on gh-pages, but you are welcome and encouraged to do so!
* The project's commit history shows at least 8 hours of work.
* Completion of the project based on the prompt _and_ objectives. The prompt contains details on the project's theme and features that are not always detailed in the objective. Carefully read through the prompt towards the end of your work session to make sure that you are not missing anything.

## Submission
