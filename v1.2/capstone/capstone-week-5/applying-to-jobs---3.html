href="#what-to-expect-in-your-job-search" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What to Expect in Your Job Search" title="Direct link to What to Expect in Your Job Search">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Before we dive into finding and applying for jobs, it‚Äôs important to set a few expectations about what a job search looks like in the current tech landscape. </p><p>Tech is a rapidly growing industry ‚Äî according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> overall employment for tech industry professionals like software developers, QA analysts, and testers is expected to grow 25% between 2022 - 2032, much faster than average for all other occupations. However, with the growing demand for coding professionals also comes growing competition, as more coding bootcamps and university computer science programs send qualified job seekers into the market. </p><p>It‚Äôs not uncommon for a job search to take time ‚Äî more than just a few weeks, but often closer to a few months. On average, it takes the majority of Epicodus graduates between 3 - 6 months to find their first role, including the time they spend in class during these assignments. Companies are notoriously slow at hiring; it can take weeks for a hiring manager to even look at the pile of applications in front of them, let alone follow up for a phone screening, interviews, or a rejection letter. </p><p>With this in mind, applying to jobs frequently, consistently, and with targeted applications that set you apart as a unique and qualified candidate are all more important than ever. It‚Äôs easy to get discouraged, and to lose motivation as you settle into your job search. Our best advice is to be patient, to be consistent, and to focus on the elements of your job search that are in your control: the quality of applications you send out, the follow up you do, and the way you build and leverage your network. Find ways to get creative, and use any of the resources and tools you have at your disposal. </p><p>Finally, remember that you are not alone in this process. Your peers in your cohort and the upper cohort above you have been in your shoes and know what you‚Äôre going through. Talk to each other. Share strategies that work, and commiserate about what doesn‚Äôt. Find ways to get creative together, attend networking events together, or even share an informational interview together. </p><p>Get in touch with alumni through LinkedIn, our alumni lunch speaker talks, or the Epicodus Alumni Discord server (available to you after you graduate), and lean on their advice and experience. </p><p>Your advisor is also always in your corner to help you, whether that means answering questions, reviewing your application materials, or just being an accountability buddy to talk to for motivation or to bounce ideas off of. Don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to them anytime you need support. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction-to-applying-to-jobs">Introduction to Applying to Jobs<a href="#introduction-to-applying-to-jobs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction to Applying to Jobs" title="Direct link to Introduction to Applying to Jobs">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The purpose of this assignment is to get you prepared for regularly applying to jobs with maximum hiring potential. Because one of the most common roadblocks to getting hired is not applying for enough jobs, our goal is to get you started early, so you can get into good habits for consistently sending out applications. Your advisor will be checking your submitted application materials to help make sure you‚Äôre on the right track. </p><p>Over the next few weeks, you&#x27;ll be expected to apply for one to three jobs depending on the week, for a total of 8 jobs before you graduate. (See the end of this lesson for more details.) On Epicenter, you will send a link to the job posting as your submission along with a link to your Google Spreadsheet job tracker OR to <a href="https://nomorecoverletter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a> if you used No More Cover Letter. Tracking your job applications will help you and your advisor  keep track of every job that you&#x27;ve applied to, as well as your targeted resumes and cover letters. It&#x27;s important to keep your tracker updated every time you apply to a job, even after you graduate from Epicodus. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="searching-for-job-postings">Searching for Job Postings‚Äã<a href="#searching-for-job-postings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Searching for Job Postings‚Äã" title="Direct link to Searching for Job Postings‚Äã">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Before you write your application materials, find a job you&#x27;d like to apply for following this <a href="https://full-time.learnhowtoprogram.com/career-services/applying-for-internships-and-jobs/job-boards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lesson on job boards</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="creating-your-job-tracker">Creating Your Job Tracker<a href="#creating-your-job-tracker" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Creating Your Job Tracker" title="Direct link to Creating Your Job Tracker">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Create your own job tracker sheet by <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tJy8guz0lt_xxN3k9Of9Ty-flkpgGXJHKHfZCy92XZQ/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">copying the template here</a>. To do so, open the link and click on &quot;File&quot; in the top left under &quot;Master Job Tracker.&quot; Then, click on the second option, &quot;Make a Copy&quot;, rename it, and save it to your Google Drive. </p><p>Before you start writing your cover letter and resume, we want to make sure you&#x27;re clear on how to do so in <a href="https://docs.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Docs</a>. To create a new Google Doc, head to the main Google Docs page and click on &#x27;Blank&#x27; under &#x27;Start a new document.&#x27; This will create an empty project for you to fill out with your resume or cover letter. There&#x27;s no need to save your work because Google Drive automatically tracks your changes.</p><p>When you&#x27;re applying for jobs, it can be easy to mix up details of different positions. A job tracker spreadsheet helps organize the jobs you&#x27;ve applied for. A good job tracker not only records the basics but also gives you a place to take notes and mark progress or next steps.</p><p>Here are the essentials to record in your job tracker:</p><ul><li>Job title</li><li>Company name</li><li>Contact information</li><li>Job posting URL (or where you heard about the job)</li><li>Tailored cover letter</li><li>Resume</li><li>Date applied</li></ul><p>You can also choose to include these details if helpful:</p><ul><li>Status of application (e.g., applied, interviewed, rejected, offer received)</li><li>Salary range</li><li>Benefits offered</li><li>Job location</li><li>Notes (e.g., interview questions, follow-up actions)</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="no-more-cover-letter">No More Cover Letter‚Äã<a href="#no-more-cover-letter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to No More Cover Letter‚Äã" title="Direct link to No More Cover Letter‚Äã">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Instead of using the Google spreadsheet job tracker, alternatively, you can use No More Cover Letter to track your job applications. To use, create an account on the <a href="https://nomorecoverletter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website here</a>. Please note that you must have a Gmail account to sign up.

It is a common pitfall for students to tailor their cover letters to different employers but send the same resume over and over.</p><p>Since you&#x27;ve already gotten feedback on a practice resume and cover letter, you should have a good idea of what to do now that you are applying for a real job. However, we want you to keep getting feedback on how to improve your applications. While working on your resume and cover letter in class, ask for help from your advisor and teacher if you have any questions or want feedback. When you&#x27;re done, you&#x27;ll submit your applications to Epicenter for review.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-note-about-cover-letters">A Note About Cover Letters<a href="#a-note-about-cover-letters" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Note About Cover Letters" title="Direct link to A Note About Cover Letters">‚Äã</a></h4><p>You‚Äôll notice in this lesson that we ask you to submit both a resume and cover letter for each of your applications, even though there will likely be jobs that you find where a cover letter is optional. </p><p>Every job you apply for should have its own unique resume and cover letter to show employers that you&#x27;re interested in them specifically. For this reason, you should not use any &quot;Quick Apply&quot; feature to apply to jobs for this assignment. Your career advisors will be checking your applications to make sure that your resumes and cover letters are targeted towards job postings.</p><p>The requirement for a cover letter is intended to give you a chance to practice updating your cover letter and an opportunity to build out additional examples for your cover letter (like we covered in the <strong>modular cover letter lesson</strong> <!-- -->[link to LHTP]<!-- -->) during class time where you can ask questions and get feedback from your advisor. In our experience, students who apply with a targeted cover letter and resume are more likely to get to the interview stage than students who do not. </p><p>None of this is to say that roles that don&#x27;t ask for a cover letter are not worth applying to, and we never want a student to have to miss out on applying to something that could be a great fit just because the company doesn&#x27;t offer an option to submit a cover letter. </p><p>However, if the cover letter is simply optional, we highly recommend including a targeted cover letter in your application, and it is a requirement for any jobs submitted for the Applying to Jobs career reviews. If you&#x27;re ever in doubt if an application counts towards these assignments, you can reach out to your advisor for support. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="submitting">Submitting‚Äã<a href="#submitting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Submitting‚Äã" title="Direct link to Submitting‚Äã">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Once you have written a resume and cover letter, send in your application to the employer!</p><p>Add the links for your resume and cover letter to your job tracking spreadsheet or to No More Cover Letter (make sure they are shared and visible to anyone with the link), and then submit your job tracker in Epicenter as your career review submission. Even though you&#x27;ve already submitted your applications, your advisor can give you feedback on your resumes and cover letters that you can use to make future applications even better.</p><p>To submit your materials as a career review using the Google spreadsheet job tracker, click on the &quot;Share&quot; button at the top of your resume, cover letter, and job search spreadsheet. It will prompt you to give your document a name and then open a window called &#x27;Share with others.&#x27; In the top-right of this window, click the button that says &#x27;Get shareable link.&#x27; Open the drop-down menu that says &#x27;Anyone with the link can view,&#x27; and change the option to &#x27;Anyone with the link can edit,&#x27; then copy the resulting link. This way, your advisor can give you feedback directly on your documents and view your job search tracker.</p><p>If you use No More Cover Letter, please paste <a href="https://nomorecoverletter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a> into the submission box for the career reviews. Please remember to click on the &quot;Share&quot; button at the top of your resume and cover letter so it says ‚ÄòAnyone with the link can edit&#x27;.
