**Goal:** Begin exploring Bootstrap by creating an HTML page that integrates multiple Bootstrap elements into its styles.

## Warm Up
---

* What setup needs to occur in order to use Bootstrap elements in a project?
* How do we add a Bootstrap component into our own project?

## Code

### Vacation Site

Make a new webpage about a place you'd like to go on vacation using Bootstrap.

* Include a [container](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/overview/) to pad all content.
* Use a [Jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/jumbotron/) to hold a title and an introductory sentence or slogan.
* Include a section with [blockquotes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/typography/) to contain what previous visitors to this area have said.
* Use additional built-in classes to add color that emphasizes certain areas of the page.

 We'll keep building this project for the next few lessons. Also, don't forget to create a Git repository, make commits regularly and push those commits to a remote repository on GitHub.
