### Vacation Site

Continue working on your webpage about a place you'd like to go on vacation by adding the following Bootstrap components:

* Include a list of vacation packages available to visit this area. Each package should include a cost, the date or range of dates its available, and the activities included in the package. Organize this information in a grid.

* In addition to Bootstrap styles, add your own stylesheet to further customize the appearance of the site.
