While we can use `console.log()` statements and `debugger` to debug our React applications, there is another very useful tool called React Developer Tools which we can use to debug our code as well.

React Developer Tools is available for both Chrome and Firefox. You can download and install the Chrome extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en).

The best way to see how React Dev Tools is useful is to see it in action. Check out this very helpful (and short) [interactive tutorial for using React Developer Tools](https://react-devtools-tutorial.now.sh/).
