Project prompts will be available on Epicenter once you let your instructor know that you have reached the end of a section. Project prompts will be available on Epicenter once you let your instructor know that you have reached the end of a section. Before you begin your project, make sure to take a moment to review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](../../pre-work/getting-started-at-epicodus/1-0-0-09-independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson.

## React Fundamentals Project Objectives
---

Even though you have learned full CRUD in this section, **you will only be expected to add CREATE, READ, and UPDATE functionality for the independent project.**

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Application compiles and runs without error, and warnings in the DevTools console are resolved.
* Functional components are used correctly.
* Application effectively uses local and shared state.
* Props are used correctly and always include `PropTypes`.
* README includes an accurate representation of the application's component tree.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The prompt's required functionality and baseline project requirements are met.

### What is a polished, portfolio-quality state?
When a project is both polished and in a portfolio-quality state, this means:

* You've reviewed your project and your README prior to submitting it to make sure there are no errors or missing information and you are consistent in your indentation, spacing, and code structure. 
* You are following the best practices and coding conventions we teach.

### What are the baseline project requirements?
All independent coding projects at Epicodus have these baseline requirements:

* A complete and informative README
* The project's commit history demonstrates that the project's required work schedule and hours have been met:
  * 8 hours of work is required for all students.
* Completion of the project based on the prompt _and_ objectives. The prompt contains details on the project's theme and features that are not always detailed in the objective. Carefully read through the prompt towards the end of your work session to make sure that you are not missing anything.
