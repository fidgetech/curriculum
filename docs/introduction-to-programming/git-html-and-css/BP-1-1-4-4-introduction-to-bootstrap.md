Even if you don't pursue a career in web design, you'll need to know enough about CSS to apply the correct classes to your code to integrate a designer's CSS. You'll also need to know how to make small changes to CSS as required by your project. This is why it's so important for both web developers _and_ designers to understand CSS basics.

Additionally, you might want to create a website that looks nice without spending a lot of time designing the user interface. In that instance, front-end frameworks are very useful. In this lesson we'll learn what a front-end framework is, how they work, and we'll begin familiarizing ourselves with Bootstrap, one of the most popular front-end frameworks for design.

## Front-End Frameworks

---

When we use the term **front-end** in web development, we're referring to the portion of a website or application that's run in the browser. This includes menus, navbars, links, and CSS designs. This is in contrast to back-end code, which doesn't run in the browser. A browser application can make a request to a server where back-end code is stored.

The front-end can also include business logic, especially if the application doesn't have a separate back-end (such as a database). The term **framework** refers to a foundation of pre-built tools, software, code, and other resources we can use to create a project more easily than if we created it from scratch.

**Front-end frameworks** are pre-built code that assist us in creating the front-end of our website. There are frameworks more focused on design like Bootstrap, which we'll discuss in a moment. There are also frameworks that are focused on JavaScript code like React and Angular.

## Bootstrap

**Bootstrap** is one of the most popular, widely used front-end design frameworks. It allows developers to quickly set up professional looking websites with minimal effort. It was originally built at Twitter to address inconsistencies in front-end design. It was later released to the public in 2011.

Bootstrap is essentially a big package containing all the code and CSS necessary to make a wide variety of commonly-used components like navigation bars, forms, headings, tables, buttons, and more. It also has built-in media queries so any Bootstrap elements we use in our own site will automatically re-style and resize themselves to best fit the user's viewport.

You can read more about Bootstrap on their website, [here](http://getbootstrap.com/).

### Websites Built with Bootstrap

Check out the following link to see some example sites built with Bootstrap:

We're going to start integrating Bootstrap into our sites, too. This will both further our knowledge of CSS, allow us to quickly create polished, professional-looking sites with far less effort. In the next lesson, we'll walk through how to download and install Bootstrap into a project.
