# Lesson and Exercise Expectations for Computer Science and Professional Development

### The Old Workflow

Prior to this course, the workflow with lessons and exercises has been that exercises were dedicated to entire class days, and lessons were dedicated to at-home reading. 

- üìñ **Book Icon**: Previously, this symbol indicated homework assignments.
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Pencil Icon**: This symbol denoted an in-class exercise that occupied the entire session.

### Updated Approach for Computer Science and Professional Development Section

- **Computer Science Section**: All materials, whether marked with a book or pencil icon, are now meant to be consumed during class time. This change aims to facilitate active learning and immediate application of concepts. 

- **Daily Coverage**: Each class session will focus on up to two or more separate technical concepts. Each of these concepts will have a brief exercise, sometimes including Jest testing, to apply your understanding of these concepts.

- **Career Service Integration**: In addition to the core computer science curriculum, there will be supplementary career service lessons with the aim of setting you up for success going forward with your job search.
