## Independent Projects Overview
---

Before you begin your project, take a moment to revisit and review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](../../pre-work/getting-started-at-epicodus/1-0-0-09-independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson.

## Database Basics Project Objectives
---

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Do the database table and column names follow proper naming conventions? 
* Do the project folder and exported database follow the specific naming requirements for this project?
* Are the instructions for re-creating your database thorough and clear?
* Is there a one-to-many relationship set up correctly in the database?
* Is CREATE functionality included for one class and is CREATE and VIEW functionality included for the other class?
* Build files and sensitive information are included in `.gitignore` file and is not to be tracked by Git, and includes instructions on how to create the `appsettings.json` and set up the project.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The prompt's required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place.

### What is a polished, portfolio-quality state?
When a project is both polished and in a portfolio-quality state, this means:

* You've reviewed your project and your README prior to submitting it to make sure there are no errors or missing information and you are consistent in your indentation, spacing, and code structure. 
* You are following the best practices and coding conventions we teach.

### What are the baseline project requirements?
All independent coding projects at Epicodus have these baseline requirements:

* A complete and informative README
* The project's commit history demonstrates that the project’s required work hours have been met:
  * 8 hours of work is required for all students.
* Completion of the project based on the prompt _and_ objectives. The prompt contains details on the project's theme and features that are not always detailed in the objective. Carefully read through the prompt towards the end of your work session to make sure that you are not missing anything.

### Previous Objectives

For reference, here are the previous sections' objectives:

* Do MVC routes follow RESTful convention?
* Classes are encapsulated and getter methods are used to access properties.
* Logic is easy to understand.
* Code and Git documentation follows best practices (descriptive variables names, proper indentation and spacing, separation between front and back-end logic, detailed commit messages in the correct tense, and a well-formatted README).
