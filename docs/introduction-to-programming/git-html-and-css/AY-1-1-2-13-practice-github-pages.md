title: '✏️ 1.1.2.13 Practice: GitHub Pages'
day: tuesday
---

**Goal**:  Walk through the process of creating and publishing to a GitHub pages page by publishing one of our previous projects.

## Warm Up
---

* We need to create something called a branch to publish our content on Github pages. We'll learn more about branches later, but for now, what is the specific name we must call the branch in order for Github pages to work correctly?
*  What is the easiest way to add new changes to a Github pages site after it's already been published?

## Code

### Publish to GitHub Pages

Now that you have learned how to host your web pages on GitHub Pages, go ahead and make your cat homepage and/or dog blog display on GitHub Pages as well. Make sure that each project properly displays for you. If it isn’t working, make sure you have confirmed your email address with GitHub.
