**Goal**: Practice using the the tags we learned in the lesson:

* `<div>` tags — places to add classes to large parts of our page and separate out content
* `<span>` tags — places to add classes to content within block elements

## Warm Up
---

* What is the difference between a `div` and a `span`?
* When would you use a `span` but _not_ a `div`?
* When would you use a `div` but _not_ a `span`?

## Code
---

Meet the goal by completing one of these projects. Make sure to make commits regularly and push to the project's remote repository on GitHub.

### Boring Lecture

* Rewrite the `boring-lecture` page and remove the `intro` class from the elements themselves, and create a `<div>` with the `intro` class to hold the elements.

### Blogging Site

* Create a new blogging website about whatever you want and use `<div>`s to group together and style each blog post.
* On the blogging website, create an "about me" section that's styled differently from the rest of the page.

### Resume Site

* Start a new webpage to house your resume. Use `<div>`s and `<span>`s to style sections for your education, work experience, skills, etc.
