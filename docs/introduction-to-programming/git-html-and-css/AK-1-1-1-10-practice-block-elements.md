**Goal:** Practice creating basic HTML webpages, with special attention toward spacing and indentation. As we begin to explore more and more complex code, proper indentation and spacing will become downright vital to maintaining clean, easy-to-manage projects. Begin developing these good habits now!

## Warm Up

_Ask yourself the following questions before moving on:_

* What does the abbreviation HTML stand for?
* Why does indentation and spacing matter?
* How do you know if a tag is an opening or closing tag?

## Code

### Indentation & Spacing Practice

Before continuing, go back and carefully check the indentation and spacing in your `my-first-webpage.html` and `favorite-things.html` files. After fixing them up, do another commit and push your code to GitHub.

### Pet Website

Now it's your turn!

Make a homepage for your cat or a blog for your dog. You can get creative here! Maybe include information about their favorite toys and their favorite activities.

Of course, you're more than welcome to make webpages about anything you want — these are just suggestions.

**Don't forget to make a new project folder, commit regularly and push to a remote repository on GitHub.**  Continue to pay close attention to indentation and closing all tags you open.
