One big issue is that it doesn't always make sense for an object to inherit all the functionality of another kind of object.

As our codebases get more complex, we could end up in a situation where we're stuck giving objects all kinds of functionality that they don't need \u2014 and some of that unneeded functionality could lead to bugs as well as code that's hard to understand.
