It's important to keep coding while you look for work. It will keep your skills sharp and demonstrate to employers that you actually like coding. Avoid tutorials and picking up new languages, and instead focus on building out a project â€” it gives you more to talk about in your interviews and better demonstrates your coding abilities. Push everything you do to Github, regardless of whether it is complete or not.

Here are some ideas of things to work on:

- Start or continue a personal project that you can add a lot of features and complexity to over time.Â  
- Contribute to an open source project, such as: 
    - github.com/epicodus/epicenter 
    - github.com/calagator 
    - github.com/operationcode 
    - Anything on [www.codemontage.com](https://www.codemontage.com/) 
    - Here are some links for finding open source work geared towards new contributors:

If you want to apply for front-end HTML/CSS focused positions, build a portfolio site. Make sure to test for [cross-browser compatibility](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=cross+browser+testing).
