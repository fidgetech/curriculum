In this course section, we'll explore the following:

* Making API calls from a React application
* Using the `useReducer()` hook to manage state
* Using React context to transfer data between two components

We'll also offer a number of optional lessons to give you starting points for doing further exploration on your own. These will include lessons on the following topics:

* React Native (for mobile development)
* SEO with React
* Creating a custom React environment
* Animations and interactivity
* Data visualization

You are expected to do some basic research on each of these topics. Then you'll choose one or two topics to incorporate in your project for this course section â€” or keep in mind for your future capstone project. Use your time wisely and make the most of it. This is a great opportunity to both broaden and deepen your knowledge of React and also to add an additional piece to your portfolio.

At the end of this course section, you will get a class session to work on professional development. At your teacher's discretion, this could happen on a different day of the week. Use this time to research companies where you might want to intern, write cover letters, apply for jobs, and touch up your LinkedIn and GitHub.

## Independent Project Objectives

For this section's code review, you will be expected to do something slightly different. Instead of receiving a new prompt, you will be using your knowledge in React to revisit and recreate your Portfolio project from week 1 of Epicodus. 

This is the time to create a portfolio that you can use in perpetuity. Look into hosting this as a website that can act as a personal advertisement for you and your most successful projects.

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* The project demonstrates a best effort of creating or starting a portfolio project.
* The README contains accurate information for the project in the state that it is submitted in.
* The hours worked quantifiably reflect the minimum requirement (8 hours for full-time, 4 hours for part-time)

As further exploration, you are encouraged to spruce up any projects that you reference in your portfolio project to ensure they are portfolio quality. Check that they have accurate READMEs and are representative of a completed application.
