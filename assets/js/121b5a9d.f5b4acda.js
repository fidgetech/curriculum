This can be very annoying. Fortunately, there's a setting in VS Code to ensure all your code is showing. Select the ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"View")," dropdown menu from the top left menu bar in VS Code, then find the option for ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"Word Wrap")," and make sure that it is selected (or checked). This forces the text in your screen to wrap inside the screen of your code editor. You can easily toggle it on or off. Occasionally, wrapping text can make it more difficult to see how code is indented \u2014 but it's generally a great tool for making sure you can see all of your code."))}c.isMDXComponent=!0},87343:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/tab-size-setting-1205b9606f4ef925a614dfb5d35f1845.png"},39330:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const
