Earlier in this course section, we asked you to begin brainstorming an MVP for your capstones. Over the next couple of weeks, you will be expected to sign up for a project and submit a proposal. We'll review the expectations and deadlines for each assignment in this lesson. 

## Selecting a Project
---

Once you've decided on a project you will be required to complete two tasks: 

1. Share your capstone idea on your cohort's designated "capstone sign-up" whiteboard or online doc, and 
2. Complete your capstone proposal as part of the second week of Professional Development code review. 

### Capstone Sign-Up

The capstone sign-up is public for everyone in your cohort to see, similar to the team week project sign-up that you've done in the past. Generally speaking for the capstone sign-up, you will write your name, language or framework, and a one-sentence summary of your project on the designated whiteboard or online doc. Your instructor will have additional details about what information they would like you to share, so follow their directions.

Note, signing up for your capstone doesn't mean that all of the details of your project should be fully developed. However, it does mean that you at least need to know which project idea you are going to work on and be able to describe the scope of the project. We've had some time to think about our Capstones with our Idea Boards, and additional meetings with your intructors - so you should have a good sense of your idea going in. The goal is have a project idea picked out before you starting working on your capstone project during the first of your dedicated class time.

If you are still undecided by the sign up deadline, reach out and let your instructor know immediately so you can plan a meeting to chat about it. 

### Capstone Project Proposal

You will complete your project proposal (using the template below) and turn it in as part of your Professional Development section's second week code review. You are welcome to work on this early, if you are able. Make sure to review the homework on [Minimum Viable Products](/capstone/capstone-week-2/capstones---the-mvp) before drafting your proposal. Knowledge of MVPs will be required to complete the questions in the template.

Double-check your work for spelling, typos and punctuation, and use professional language and technical terms as you would in a project proposal completed for a supervisor or manager. 

### Deadlines

* **Capstone Sign-Up**: You will sign up with a descriptive, one-sentence summary of your project on the designated whiteboard or online doc during the Professional Development course section. This sign-up will be public to your cohort. Your instructor may ask for more or less information, and you need to follow their instructions.

    *  Due date: For full-time and part-time students, this is due during the first week of the Professional Development course section.

* **Capstone Proposal**:  You are required to submit a project proposal outlining your MVP (minimum viable product) for the second week of Professional Development code review. More information, including the proposal form may be found [here](/capstone/capstone-week-2/capstones---sign-ups-and-proposal).

    *  Due date: For full-time and part-time students, this will be turned in as part of your Professional Development's second week code review.
