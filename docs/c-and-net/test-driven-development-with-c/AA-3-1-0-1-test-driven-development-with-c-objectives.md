title: "ðŸ““ 3.1.0.1 Test-Driven Development with C# Objectives"
day: weekend
---

Welcome to C# and .NET! We'll spend this course section unpacking concepts from the pre-work and familiarizing ourselves with C# development in general. We'll dive deeper into object-oriented programming, C# tools, and build console applications.

We will also continue to practice Test-Driven Development with MSTest, building off of both the pre-work lessons and the Test-Driven Development techniques and best practices that you learned in JavaScript.

## Independent Project Objectives
---

At the end of this section, you will complete an independent project. Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Code includes two custom classes and uses namespaces.
* Console application works correctly.
* Application correctly uses auto-implemented properties.
* Classes should include methods for determining the price of an order.
* Models are thoroughly tested.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The promptâ€™s required functionality and baseline project requirements are met.

### Previous Objectives

* Logic is easy to understand.
* Variable names are clear and descriptive.
* A well-formatted README with a description of the program, setup instructions, a copyright, a license, the GitHub URL of your repo, and your name has been included.
* The project includes regular commits with clear messages that finish the phrase _"This commit will..."_.
* Code has proper indentation and spacing.
