An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is a program designed to help recruiting and HR teams streamline their hiring process.

These web apps will input your resume and cover letter directly into the employer\u2019s system. Most ATS will also scan your resume for keywords associated with the job, and will automatically reject applications that don\u2019t have enough of the qualifications to be considered. This is another reason why it\u2019s very important to make sure your resume and cover letter directly address the job requirements. You might be very qualified and still be rejected for a job if you don\u2019t take the time to tailor your application and make sure you hit the right keywords. You might have seen advice online about adding all the job keywords in white text to the resume so that they are hidden from sight but still scannable by the ATS \u2013 do not do this!

It isn\u2019t necessarily a bad idea to reapply, but some companies have a mandatory cooling off period before you can re-apply to any other roles within the company. This can be anywhere from six to twelve months. These blocks are common at large tech companies who receive a very high volume of applicants. You may not get another chance to be considered at a company for several months, so it\u2019s important to make sure that you are giving each application your best shot. Use a tool like ",(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://jobscan.co"},"jobscan.co")," to check your application against an ATS before applying. "),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Additionally, keep Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) in mind when you format your resume.
