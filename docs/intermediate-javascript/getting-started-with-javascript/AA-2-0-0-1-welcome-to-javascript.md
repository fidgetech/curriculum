Welcome to the wonderful world of JavaScript!

You've already gotten a taste of this language from your Intro to Programming course, and in this course, we're going to dive a little deeper.

In this JavaScript course, we'll cover using constructors and prototypal methods to fully utilize the power of JavaScript as an object-oriented language. We'll begin learning how to use more powerful build tools such as webpack for managing JavaScript applications that use the browser. We'll also learn how to use testing tools such as Jest to test our applications. Finally, we'll incorporate new ES6 functionality and explore working with asynchronous code and APIs.
