## Independent Projects Overview
---

Before you begin your project, make sure to take a moment to review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](https://old.learnhowtoprogram.com/fidgetech-1-introduction-to-programming/1-0-getting-started-at-epicodus/1-0-0-09-independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson.

## Object-Oriented JavaScript Project Objectives
---

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Constructors and prototypes are used successfully.
* Application works as expected.
* Tests are included for each business logic behavior and code is committed after each test passes.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The prompt’s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.

### What is a polished, portfolio-quality state?
When a project is both polished and in a portfolio-quality state, this means:

* You've reviewed your project and your README prior to submitting it to make sure there are no errors or missing information and you are consistent in your indentation, spacing, and code structure. 
* You are following the best practices and coding conventions we teach.

### What are the baseline project requirements?
All independent coding projects at Epicodus have these baseline requirements:

* A complete and informative README
* The project's commit history shows at least 8 hours of work.
* Completion of the project based on the prompt _and_ objectives. The prompt contains details on the project's theme and features that are not always detailed in the objective. Carefully read through the prompt towards the end of your work session to make sure that you are not missing anything.

## Submission
