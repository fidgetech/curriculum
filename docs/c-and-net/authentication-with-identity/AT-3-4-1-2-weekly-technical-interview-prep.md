At the end of the course section, we'll take a break from coding to practice interview questions with our partner. These questions will (primarily) revolve around the content we learned in this section, and, much like a "real" interview, some will be more technical than others.

In addition to learning how to implement the new tools, technologies, and concepts, you want to become comfortable _talking_ about them too, so you may accurately _demonstrate_ and _communicate_ these skills you've learned to potential employers in an interview.

Take turns answering the questions below with your partner:

## Technical Interview Questions
---

* What is the difference between Identity and Entity?
* What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
* How can we call an async method in C#? Why would we want to?
* What tools and functionalities are required to make an API call in our projects?
* What is the purpose of a View Model? How does it fit into our MVC structure?

## Stories and Examples

Offering a tangible story or example that highlights your skills usually goes _much further_ in an interview than simply _telling_ your interviewer you're good at something. (i.e.: Telling a story about a time you tracked down a tricky bug versus simply saying _"I'm good at problem-solving!"_).

Review the **STAR** method, discussed in [this lesson on non-technical interviews](https://old.learnhowtoprogram.com/internship-and-job-search/preparing-for-job-interviews/non-technical-interview). Use the **STAR** method to practice answering non-technical questions with your partner.

Again, if you come up with a story or example you feel good about, jot it down somewhere! It's tough to come up with stories like this in an interview on the spot. Having a few tucked away to review before an interview will be a huge benefit to you later.
