**Goal**:  Now that we've learned about how to change previous commits, let's put this new information into practice!

## Warm Up
<hr />

* When can you use the `git commit --amend` command to change a commit message?
* What are the two things that the `git rebase -i` command can do?

## Code
<hr />

Complete the following exercise.

### Rewriting Git History

Using the process outlined in the "Git: Rewriting History with Rebase" lesson, go back and alter two of the commits from a previous project: 

* Use the `--amend` flag to change the most recent commit.
* The rebase command to change any commit other than the most recent. Choose to either reword a commit message or squash and combine two commits. 

Everyone in your pair or group should alter two commits.
