## Independent Projects Overview
---

Welcome to your first C# independent project! Before you begin your project, make sure to take a moment to review the [Independent Projects and Code Reviews](https://old.learnhowtoprogram.com/fidgetech-1-introduction-to-programming/1-0-getting-started-at-epicodus/1-0-0-09-independent-projects-and-code-reviews) lesson.

## Test-Driven Development with C# Project Objectives
---

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Code includes two custom classes and uses namespaces.
* Console application works correctly.
* Application correctly uses auto-implemented properties.
* Classes should include methods for determining the price of an order.
* Models are thoroughly tested.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The prompt’s required functionality and baseline project requirements are met.

### What is a polished, portfolio-quality state?
When a project is both polished and in a portfolio-quality state, this means:

* You've reviewed your project and your README prior to submitting it to make sure there are no errors or missing information and you are consistent in your indentation, spacing, and code structure. 
* You are following the best practices and coding conventions we teach.

### What are the baseline project requirements?
All independent coding projects at Epicodus have these baseline requirements:

* A complete and informative README.
* The project's commit history demonstrates that the project’s required work hours have been met:
  * 8 hours of work is required for all students.
* Completion of the project based on the prompt _and_ objectives. The prompt contains details on the project's theme and features that are not always detailed in the objective. Carefully read through the prompt towards the end of your work session to make sure that you are not missing anything.

### Previous Objectives

* Logic is easy to understand.
* Variable names are clear and descriptive.
* A well-formatted README with a description of the program, setup instructions, a copyright, a license, the GitHub URL of your repo, and your name has been included.
* The project includes regular commits with clear messages that finish the phrase _"This commit will..."_.
* Code has proper indentation and spacing.
