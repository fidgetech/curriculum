Today we'll be working on job application materials. We'll write a practice resume and cover letter, and we'll spruce up our LinkedIn and Github profiles. We'll work in pairs, helping each other out and giving feedback, but we'll also each work on our own materials.

As needed revisit these lessons on the internship process and writing your resume and cover letter:

* [Internship Overview](/internship-and-job-search/internship-process/internship-overview)
* [Writing Cover Letters and Resumes](/internship-and-job-search/applying-for-internships-and-jobs/writing-cover-letters-and-resumes)
* [Write Your Cover Letter](/internship-and-job-search/applying-for-internships-and-jobs/writing-your-cover-letter)
* [Write Your Resume](/internship-and-job-search/applying-for-internships-and-jobs/writing-your-resume)

Remember, you have two career reviews due soon! Go to Epicenter, navigate to the Internship course, and review the prompts for **Resume Review** and **Cover Letter Review**.

Please reach out to your advisor with any questions that come up.
