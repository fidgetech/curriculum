# Fidgetech Workshop

This workshop is intended as an introductory experience to what the full-stack program at Epicodus has to offer. During this workshop, you will get a small taste of several concepts that we cover throughout the first few weeks of Epicodus.

Here’s some of what we’ll cover:

* HTML and CSS: The presentation and styling languages of the web
* JavaScript: The programming language of the web
* Bootstrap: A framework for easily creating good-looking websites
* jQuery: A library that makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation simple

You'll start with the [this lesson](/workshop/workshop/welcome-to-the-workshop).
