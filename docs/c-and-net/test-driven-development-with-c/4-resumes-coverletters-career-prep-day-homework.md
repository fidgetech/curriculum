We're going to dedicate all of the next class session to working on job application materials. We'll write a practice resume and cover letter, and we'll spruce up our LinkedIn and Github profiles.

Students at the Portland or Seattle campus, if you can, bring a laptop to the next class session. We'll work in pairs, helping each other out and giving feedback, but we'll each work on our own materials.

The next few lessons are for homework. They'll get you oriented with the internship process and writing resumes and cover letters.
