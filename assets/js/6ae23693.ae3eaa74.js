To be clear, this isn\u2019t your purpose in a broader sense, but specifically the purpose of the professional development plan you\u2019re making.

Now, let\u2019s say when you were reflecting on that goal, you identified a skill they prioritize that you don\u2019t have. The purpose of the professional development plan isn\u2019t to get hired at this company. It\u2019s to build the skill you\u2019re missing (so you can work towards getting hired at this company).

Compare your existing skills with the ones that would be most useful to get where you\u2019re going. You might see a tool that comes up again and again in job postings, for instance, that you don\u2019t know how to use. Alternatively, maybe you\u2019ve gotten feedback from interviews or networking connections that a skill you already have is less developed than is ideal.

In cases like this, the way that it\u2019s professionally useful may not be about the skill itself, but about showing employers that you\u2019re proactive about continuing to learn and grow. It\u2019s also very possible that the thing you\u2019re interested in will be more directly valuable than it seems. As an example, let\u2019s say you really want to learn Elixir. You\u2019re not going to find it at the top of any lists of in demand developer skills, so you probably wouldn\u2019t capture it as a choice using industry research or skill gaps.
