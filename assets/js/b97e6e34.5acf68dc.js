You might see a tool that comes up again and again in job postings, for instance, that you don\u2019t know how to use.

It\u2019s also very possible that the thing you\u2019re interested in will be more directly valuable than it seems. As an example, let\u2019s say you really want to learn Elixir. You\u2019re not going to find it at the top of any lists of in demand developer skills, so you probably wouldn\u2019t capture it as a choice using industry research or skill gaps.
