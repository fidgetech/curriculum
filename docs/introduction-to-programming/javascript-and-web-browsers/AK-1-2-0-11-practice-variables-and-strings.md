**Goal:** Practice creating and utilizing variables and strings by completing the exercises listed below. Variables and strings are both a fundamental building block of programming, so begin getting comfortable with them now!

In the Variables lesson, we learned:

* Variables, in JavaScript, are written in lower camelCase.
* In modern JavaScript, variables are created using `let` and `const`.
* Variables can be used in arithmetic.

In the Strings lesson, we learned:

* Strings can include letters, punctuation, and numbers.
* Strings are surrounded with quotation marks (double or single).
* Variables can be set equal to strings.
* To escape characters use the backslash `\` character.

## Warm Up
---

* When are `let` and `const` used? What do they mean — and how are they different from `var`?
* How can we use a variable after we've defined it?
* How do we declare a string?
* Can we create strings with either single or double quotes?
* What's the difference between `"9"` with quotes and `9` without?

## Code

### Variables and Strings Practice

Here are a few exercises for you to practice using variables in the DevTools console:

* Set a variable called `someName` equal to your name in a string. We should be able to reassign the value of `someName`, so choose whether you should use `let` or `const` to declare this variable.
* Display the value of `someName` in the console.
* Change the value of `someName` to another name.
* Set a variable called `favoriteNumber` equal to your favorite number. The variable `favoriteNumber` should not be able to be reassigned, so choose whether you should use `let` or `const` to declare this variable.
* Calculate what your favorite number divided by 2 is, and save the result in a new variable called `halfOfFavNum`. This variable should not be able to be reassigned, so choose whether you should use `let` or `const` to declare this variable.
* Set another variable called `michaelsFavorite` equal to `13`. We should be able to reassign the value of `michaelsFavorite`, so choose whether you should use `let` or `const` to declare this variable.
* Subtract your favorite number from Michael's.
* Change the value of `michaelsFavorite` to be 26 times its current value.
