[Optionally, see this repo for a walkthrough of deploying a React project.](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) \n \n## Further Exploration\n---\n \n### Configure a Publishing Source\n \nIt\u2019s possible to configure our GitHub Pages site to publish when changes are pushed to a specific branch, or we can write a GitHub Actions workflow to publish our site. So for instance we could set our `main` branch as the publishing source and have GitHub automatically deploy any time changes are pushed to the `main` branch. [See this page in the GitHub docs for how to set a custom publishing source.](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)\n \n### Enforce HTTPS\n \nBy default GitHub enforces HTTPS protocol (not HTTP), so you may get errors if your links use HTTP. For the deployed site you'll need to remove any HTTP content. [See this page on enforcing HTTPS in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https#resolving-problems-with-mixed-content) for more information.\n \n### Un-Publish the Website\n \nIf you want to remove a site from GitHub Pages so it is no longer hosted, [you can find instructions for un-publishing here.](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/unpublishing-a-github-pages-site)\n \nAnd that's it! Our site should be live on GitHub Pages for the whole world to visit.\n")))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
