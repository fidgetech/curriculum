title: "ðŸ““ 1.0.0.24 Installing and Using Discord"
day: weekend
---

We use Discord as our online classroom. With Discord, we can message, talk, and share screens with each other. 

In preparation, please follow along with the steps below (and subsequent lessons) to install and familiarize yourself with Discord.

## [Installing Discord](#installing-discord)

---

1. First, create an account at [https://discordapp.com/register](https://discordapp.com/register). Choose a username in Discord that matches your real name in some way â€” this way, we'll know who you are. Then enter your email address and a password to claim that username. 

2. You can use Discord in the browser or through its desktop application. We recommend installing the Discord application, because it has more features. Discord will be installed and available on all Epicodus computers, though in-person students likely will find using Discord in the browser more convenient. You can [install Discord here](https://discord.com/download). Simply choose the distribution for your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux). If you are using Discord in the browser, bookmark the link to the Discord server.

## [Configuring Discord](#configuring-discord)

1. Find your username on the right side of the screen, right-click it, and click "Change Nickname". Enter your full name as your nickname so that staff and other students know who you are.

2. When first using voice, video, and screen sharing you may have to set security permissions with your computer allowing Discord to access your microphone, screen, and camera. If you see a pop-up in the process of configuring Discord, follow along with the prompts to give Discord permission to access the necessary hardware. 

3. Test your microphone by clicking the _User Settings_ gear in the bottom left corner: ![Discord user settings gear](https://learnhowtoprogram.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/discord_user_settings_gear.png) Then, click _Voice & Video_ from the menu on the left. You should see an option to test your mic. Please make sure you have a working microphone before the first day of class. 

4. Next, test your video. Just like you did for your microphone, go to _User Settings_, then click _Voice & Video_. Scroll down on the page and to the _Video Settings_ section and select the button to "test video". While video isn't strictly required, using video when you work with an instructor improves community building and makes it easier to form friendships. Video is also vital for remote interviews. For those reasons, we recommend having a working video camera before the first day of class.
