We can take a depth-first search (DFS) approach or a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. You can probably guess a little bit about each approach. If we are looking at a tree that has a root node and child nodes, a depth-first search algorithm will search a tree vertically while a breadth-first search algorithm will search a tree horizontally. A graph can\'t really be measured vertically or horizontally in this way but the same concept still applies \u2014 we can search broadly or go deeper into each branch first. We just don\'t necessarily do so from a root node. Instead, we can start our search from any node in the graph.","sidebar":"capstone"},"capstone/capstone-week-1/depth-first-algorithms":{"id":"capstone/capstone-week-1/depth-first-algorithms","title":"\ud83d\udcd3 Depth First Algorithms","description":"In the last lesson, we covered depth-first search and breadth-first search approaches.

This type of data structure isn\'t as directly relevant to what we\'ve covered at Epicodus \u2014 after all, languages like JavaScript handle memory allocation for us. However, we are benefiting constantly from heaps all the same. Our machines use them constantly to allocate memory. JavaScript\'s V8 engines uses them to store variables as needed. And a basic understanding of this data structure is still an important computer science concept.","sidebar":"capstone"},"capstone/capstone-week-1/insertion-sort":{"id":"capstone/capstone-week-1/insertion-sort","title":"\ud83d\udcd3 Insertion Sort","description":"In this lesson, we\'ll take a look at the insertion sort algorithm. This algorithm uses O(n2) time, so it\'s not a good choice for large lists. Interestingly enough, this algorithm isn\'t a bad choice for smaller lists, though. Why is that? Well, some of the algorithms that are efficient for large lists have a high constant while the insertion sort algorithm has a low constant. Think of it like this: if you want to give a letter to your neighbor next door, is it faster to just walk next door or deliver it by mail? It\'s faster to just go next door \u2014 because there is no overhead of a constant to worry about. On the other hand, the further away you need to go to mail a letter, the more it makes sense to send it via the post office instead of hand delivering it.","sidebar":"capstone"},"capstone/capstone-week-1/introduction-to-algorithms":{"id":"capstone/capstone-week-1/introduction-to-algorithms","title":"\ud83d\udcd3 Introduction to Algorithms","description":"During this section, we\'ll take a deeper dive into some well-known algorithms.

We can use Big O to describe the overall performance of an algorithm. Big O is short for order of, which we can also think of as the algorithm\'s rate of growth, whether that rate of growth is the amount of time the algorithm takes or the space it takes up in memory. In other words, Big O is used both to measure the runtime of an algorithm (how long it takes to execute) and the space of an algorithm (how much space it takes in memory). Generally, the most common concern is Big O runtime but we\'ll also briefly touch on Big O space as well.","sidebar":"capstone"},"capstone/capstone-week-1/introduction-to-graphs":{"id":"capstone/capstone-week-1/introduction-to-graphs","title":"\ud83d\udcd3 Introduction to Graphs","description":"In computer science, a graph (also known as a network) is a collection of nodes (also known as vertices) and edges (also known as links or relations).

The study of graphs is known as graph theory and it fits into the larger field of network theory, which is useful for understanding everything from social networks to databases.","sidebar":"capstone"},"capstone/capstone-week-1/introduction-to-hash-tables":{"id":"capstone/capstone-week-1/introduction-to-hash-tables","title":"\ud83d\udcd3 Introduction to Hash Tables","description":"Hash tables are one of the most important data structures you can possibly learn.

We\'ll start by looking at how a low-level language like C or C++ stores various pieces of information in either a stack or a heap. We\'ll also learn a bit more about garbage collection, the process of removing variables that are no longer in scope, and memory leaks, which is when variables and other code we are no longer using remain in memory (kind of like old food in the fridge that just takes up space).","sidebar":"capstone"},"capstone/capstone-week-1/merge-sort":{"id":"capstone/capstone-week-1/merge-sort","title":"\ud83d\udcd3 Merge Sort","description":"At this point, we\'ve looked at several sorting algorithms that have a Big O of O(N2): the bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort algorithms.
